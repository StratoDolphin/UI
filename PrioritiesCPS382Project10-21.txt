Priorities
1. Health Bar
	-Main Character Health & Stamina Bar: done on 10/21/2017
	-Enemy Health bar: done on 10/21/2017
		 Make Enemy Health Bar look at the camera, then NPC's. Half done 10/22/2017. Need to find out how to use "Look At" function without changing position.

2. NPC's
	-When near them, have a text thing that says, "Press A to talk": Done
	-When the user presses A, the text of the NPC shows.: Done
	-After all of the text is done, make the NPC go back to "Press A to talk" and let the text loop again.

3. Inventory
	//Right now I have it so when the user presses R, it heals the Player's Health
	-When the user collects the item, the item will be passed into the Inventory GUI (Haven't created this yet).
	-When the user clicks on that item in the Inventory GUI, the item will do its "Effect".

Error: 
	When your branch says there's a merge conflict in the Unity Scene (I might have switched up the directions by mistake), just:
		-Go to your repository, hit the settings tab, scroll all the way down and delete the repository.
		-Make a new one with the UI title.
		-Go to UI in Powershell and clone your new repository.
		-Make sure you have a copy of your UI in your desktop, delete UI folder in your U drive.
		-Copy the UI from your Desktop into the U drive. Run git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories.
		-Now you can add, commit, and push with no errors.
